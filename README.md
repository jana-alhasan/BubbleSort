# BubbleSort
This is an animated gif that demonstrates how the bubble sort algorithm works. It shows an array of randomly generated numbers being sorted in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements until the array is fully sorted. The animation highlights the elements being compared and swapped in each iteration of the algorithm.
